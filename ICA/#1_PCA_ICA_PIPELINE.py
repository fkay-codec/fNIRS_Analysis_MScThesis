fNIRS Resting-State PCA and FastICA Analysis - Spatial Map Generation


PURPOSE:
This script performs PCA and FastICA on preprocessed fNIRS resting-state data to generate Independent Component (IC) spatial maps for 
subsequent motor-RSFC analysis, following Zhang et al. (2010) methodology.
This script replicates partially Zhang et al. 2010, and makes several improvements:
    - Implements PCA for dimensionality reduction before FastICA
    - uses skew function as Zhang, and logcosh as alternative
    - because a fixed seed is deterministic, we run the FastICA multiple times with a random seed, while ensuring reproducability by using a fixed starting point and adding +i to it where i is the number of the runs
        - this way a common pitfall is avoided: using one random seed, one time gives one specific output, and when you run it again it gives another.
        - This is because the random seed is not fixed, so the random number generator is not initialized with the same seed every time.
        - Based on the above, when we run it multiple times with a random seed then the results become more stable
Later scripts further improve the methodology by:
    - Implementing a more robust IC selection that does not rely on visual inspection
    - Specifically, it selects the ICs that have the highest spatial correlation with the motor task GLM T-maps
    - then the ICs are aligned with the motor task glm maps (because ICA is sign agnotistic)
    - Best ICs across all runs are then saved in a dataframe for each subject
    - Then from the best ICs from each subject the median is taken to ensure stability of our results (and reproducability with a static starting point)
    - Finally the averaged ICs are used for group analysis, which is more robust than using the best ICs from each subject
==> All these improvements make ICA a robust and reliable method for fNIRS resting state analysis

METHODOLOGY OVERVIEW:
Based on Zhang et al. (2010) with the following pipeline:

1. DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION (PCA)
---------------------------------
   - Apply PCA separately to HbO and HbR signals
   - Retain components explaining 99% of variance
   - Reduces computational load while preserving signal information
   
2. INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS (FastICA)
--------------------------------------------
   - Apply FastICA to PCA-reduced data
   - Number of ICs = Number of retained PCs
   - Extract spatially independent components from temporal signals
   
   FastICA Parameters (matching Zhang et al. 2010 MATLAB implementation):
   - Iterations: 10,000 (max_iter=10000)
   - Approach: "deflation" (algorithm="deflation") 
   - Initial value: "random" (random_state=None)
   - Nonlinearity: "skew" g(u)=uÂ² (custom fun=skew)
   
    Note: Some MATLAB FastICA parameters not available in scikit-learn:
   - Step length: 0.00001 (no direct equivalent)
   - Fine-tune: "on" (not implemented)
   - Stabilization: "on" (not implemented)

3. SPATIAL MAP RECONSTRUCTION
-----------------------------
    - To recover spatial maps of each IC in the original channel space, the ICA mixing matrix 
    [the weights needed to reconstruct the PCA components; Each IC as a linear combination 
    of PCs] was multiplied by the PCA component matrix [the weights needed to reconstruct 
    the original channel contributions; Each PC as a linear combination of channels]. 
Script:
   - Recover IC spatial patterns in original channel space
        - Matrix multiplication: A = pca.components_.T @ ica_fit.mixing_
   - Z-score normalization of spatial maps for standardization
Code Explanation:
   - pca.components_.T: Channel contributions to each PC
   - ica_fit.mixing_: IC contributions from each PC
   - A: Final spatial maps (channels x ICs)

4. DATA ORGANIZATION
--------------------
   - Generate DataFrames with channels as rows, ICs as columns
   - Separate processing for HbO and HbR chromophores
   - Export to Excel with organized sheet structure

INPUT REQUIREMENTS:
    - folder '_SatPrep' suffix with snirf files 
    - SNIRF files must be preprocessed:
        - Converted to concentration changes (HbO/HbR)
        - Event-trimmed to uniform duration
        - Trimmed to reach steady state (first 20 sec last 20 seconds)
        - Detrended (1st order and 2nd order polynomial removal)
        - Bandpass filtered (0.01-0.2 Hz for resting-state frequencies)
OUTPUT FILES:
Excel files per subject: [SubjectID]_(...).xlsx
    - Two sheets per file:
        - 'HbO Spatial Maps': ICs for HbO channels
        - 'HbR Spatial Maps': ICs for HbR channels

SELECTION OF ICs:
! Not performed in this script; it is computationally intensive and done in a separate script
- Zhang et al. used visual inspection to select the ICs per subject 
    (ICs selection based on low frequency compoenents, that cover bilateral 
    motor areas for RSFC of motor areas)
    - There are better ways to do that, that enhance replicability and reproducibility:
        - Choose the IC that has the highest spatial correlation 
        with the spatial map of the motor areas (group-level GLM 
        analysis with motor event as predictor, yields this spatial map)
        - To ensure that the ICs dont have a high frequency content, bandpass the 
        data before PCA/ICA with a broad bandpass filter (in this case 0.01-0.2Hz)
--------------------------------

Best pracrices:
1.  Run ICA multiple times (e.g., 10-50 runs), each with a 
    different random_state. Use a fixed tolerance level (e.g., 1e-6)
    to ensure stability across runs.
2.  For each run, calculate the spatial correlation between
    each IC and your motor reference map.
3.  Track the best match across all runs, and log the following:
        - Max correlation coefficient,
        - Which IC from which run it came from,
        - The sign of the IC (since ICA is sign-agnostic).
You can then either:
a.  Pick the IC with the highest correlation across all runs (most common and simple).
        - align the sign of the IC with the reference map before saving. (this will be useful later for group analysis, otherwise its invalid)
b.  Or, average the best-matching ICs across runs (after sign alignment), if you're concerned about overfitting or instability.

Pseudo-code/steps for the above:
Part 1 of the code: FastICA with multiple runs
    1. for each subject run the ICA multiple times (N times) with a random seed 
    with fixed tolerance 
        Note: for reproducability and stability the random seed can have a specific starting point and then +i for each run; to validate the procedure pick different starting points and compare results; or just track the random seed generated
    2. store the resulting ICs and their spatial maps in a dataframe: each_run_ICs_df
    ! this script stops here, the next part is in a different script
    3. for each IC calculate the spatial correlation with the motor reference map
    4. find the IC with the highest correlation
        a. perform sign alignment with the reference map
        b. store it in a new dataframe: best_ICs_df 
    5. save the best_ICs_df to an excel file with the subject ID in the filename

Output: Now you have the best_ICs per subject alligned and you have to decide how to proceed with IC selection.
--------------------------------
Part 2 of the code: IC selection
Part A: Use the best ICs from each subject across all runs and perform a group analysis
    1. load the best_ICs_df (name, dataframe)
    2. for each name (subject ID) in the dataframe:
        a. correlate the ICs with the group-level motor reference map
        b. select the IC with the highest correlation
        c. store the selected IC in a new dataframe: selected_ICs_df (name, dataframe)
            Note: check if sign is aligned with the reference map; if it isnt it will lead to a logical bug and the results are invalid
        d. save the selected_ICs_df to an excel file with the subject ID in the filename
        e. perform the group analysis on the selected ICs
        f. save the group analysis results to an excel file with the subject ID in the filename
Part B: Tale the median from the best ICs for each subject and perform a group analysis
    1. load the best_ICs_df (name, dataframe) per run
    2. for each name (subject ID) in the dataframe:
        a. correlate the ICs across all runs to see if they are stable
            Note: before doing that check if IC sign is aligned
        b. if they are stable, average the ICs across all runs (they should be stable, if not, then you need to check the procedure)
        c. store the median IC in a new dataframe: averaged_ICs_df (name, dataframe)
        d. save the averaged_ICs_df to an excel file with the subject ID in the filename
    3. perform the group analysis across subjects on the averaged ICs
    4. save the group analysis results to an excel file and you are golden

NOTE: total running time for: 23 subjects x 50 runs x 2 functions = 2300 runs in 17.2hrs
NOTE: logcosh function is slower than skew

                    these are the weights that define how each original channel contributes to each principal component
                ica_fit.mixing_ : ica_fit.mixing_ shape: (21, 21)
                    ica_fit.mixing_ is the mixing matrix from ICA.
                    it contains the weights that define how each independent component (IC) is formed from the original channels
                    how they combine to reconstruct the original data
                by multiplying the PCA componets and their loadings with the ICA mixing matrix, we can reconstruct the independent components (ICs) in terms of the original channels
